# Ben Hamel's Dev Portfolio

This is a website built to showcase my personal projects to the world.

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me how not to reinvent the wheel. I knew I wanted a personal portfolio, but I was still determining how I wanted it to look. Taking the time to find websites I liked and drawing inspiration from them helped point me in the right direction. I realized that less is more and how to best approach adding CSS classes to a non-framework-based website.
